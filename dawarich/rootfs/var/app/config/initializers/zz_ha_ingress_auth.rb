# Named zz_* so it loads after upstream's devise and omniauth initializers.
#
# Home Assistant puts the signed-in user in X-Remote-User-Id on ingress requests
# and strips any copy the browser sent, so through ingress that header is as
# trustworthy as HA's own login. nginx passes it on, together with the shared
# secret below, only for requests coming from Supervisor's address. Anything
# else, including port 3000 and other containers on the hassio network, arrives
# without an identity and gets the normal login form.
#
# The identity is only ever used to *find* an account, never to change one:
# an existing Dawarich user is adopted by stamping provider/uid on it, which
# leaves its points, tracks and settings exactly as they were.
