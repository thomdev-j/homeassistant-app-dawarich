# Dawarich Home Assistant App

**This app runs a full [Dawarich](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich) instance directly on your Home Assistant OS device** — a self-hosted alternative to Google Timeline. No separate server or Docker Compose setup needed. Just install, and you have location tracking with full control of your data.

## Overview

Everything is bundled into a single app container:

- **PostgreSQL 17 + PostGIS** — spatial database
- **Redis 7.4** — cache and job queue
- **Dawarich** — Rails web application
- **Sidekiq** — background job processor
- **Nginx** — ingress reverse proxy

## Installation

1. Add this repository to your Home Assistant app store
2. Install the Dawarich app (the image is roughly 1 GB — initial download may take a while)
3. Adjust configuration options (see below)
4. Start the app — first boot initializes the database and compiles assets, subsequent starts are fast (under 15 seconds)
5. Open the web UI via the sidebar panel or at `http://<your-ha-ip>:3000`
6. Log in with the admin credentials from your app config

## Configuration

### General

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `admin_email` | `admin@dawarich.local` | Email address used to log into Dawarich as admin. |
| `admin_password` | `changeme` | Password for the admin account. **Change this!** Only used on first creation — change password through the Dawarich UI after that. |
| `time_zone` | `Etc/UTC` | Timezone for the application (e.g., `America/New_York`, `Europe/Berlin`). |
| `database_password` | `dawarich` | Internal PostgreSQL password. Not exposed externally. |
| `application_hosts` | `homeassistant.local,localhost` | Comma-separated hostnames/IPs Rails accepts. Only needed for direct port 3000 access — ingress works without it. Add your HA IP if you get "blocked host" errors. |
| `background_processing_concurrency` | `5` | Sidekiq worker threads (1-20). Lower on constrained devices like Raspberry Pi 3. |

### Device Tracking

The app subscribes to Home Assistant's real-time event stream and pushes location updates to Dawarich the instant your device reports a new position. No polling, no delays — just set `ha_tracked_entities` and it works.

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ha_tracked_entities` | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated list of `device_tracker.*` entity IDs to track. Leave empty to disable. |
| `ha_min_distance` | `10` | Minimum distance in meters before a new position is recorded (0-1000). Filters GPS drift when stationary. Set to `0` to disable. |

**Basic usage** — track a single device under the admin user:
```
ha_tracked_entities: "device_tracker.my_phone"
```

**Multi-user** — create separate Dawarich users per person by adding a `:Name` suffix:
```
ha_tracked_entities: "device_tracker.my_phone:Alice, device_tracker.partner_phone:Bob"
```

This creates `alice@dawarich.local` and `bob@dawarich.local` with default password `password`. Each device's location data is sent to its own user. Users can change their password after first login via the Dawarich settings page. Once multiple users exist, you can use Dawarich's built-in **Family** feature to see everyone on a shared map with different colors.

Entities without a `:Name` suffix use the admin user. You can mix both styles:
```
ha_tracked_entities: "device_tracker.my_phone:Alice, device_tracker.tablet"
```

#### How It Works

The tracker subscribes to Home Assistant's Server-Sent Events stream for real-time `state_changed` events. Location updates are pushed to Dawarich the moment your phone reports a new position to HA — no polling delay. Check the app logs for `connected — receiving real-time state changes` to confirm it's active.

Duplicate locations (same lat/lon) are always skipped. Positions closer than `ha_min_distance` meters (default: 10m) to the last recorded point are also filtered to prevent GPS drift noise.

### Important Notes

- **`application_hosts`** must include the hostname/IP you use to access the UI, or Rails will reject requests (not needed for ingress)
- **`secret_key_base`** is auto-generated on first start and stored in `/data/dawarich/secret_key_base` — sessions are invalidated if this file is deleted
- **Admin user** is created on first start with the configured email/password. The password is only set on creation — changing it in the app config won't update an existing user. Use the Dawarich UI to change passwords.

## Data Persistence

All data is stored under `/data/` and survives app restarts and updates:

- `/data/postgres/` — PostgreSQL data directory
- `/data/redis/` — Redis persistence files
- `/data/dawarich/storage/` — User uploads and exports
- `/data/dawarich/secret_key_base` — Auto-generated secret key
- `/data/dawarich/api_keys/` — Per-entity API keys for HA tracking

## Backups

Home Assistant backups are supported:

- **Pre-backup:** PostgreSQL is dumped to `/data/dawarich/backup.sql` via `pg_dumpall`
- **Post-backup:** The SQL dump is cleaned up to save disk space
- Raw PostgreSQL files (`postgres/**`) are excluded from the backup — only the SQL dump is included

To restore from backup, the app will automatically detect and restore the SQL dump on startup if the PostgreSQL data directory is empty.

## Network Security

- PostgreSQL binds to `localhost` only — port 5432 is **not** exposed outside the container
- Redis binds to `localhost` only — port 6379 is **not** exposed outside the container
- Only port 3000 (web UI) is exposed
- The app supports Home Assistant ingress for secure access without exposing port 3000

## Troubleshooting

### App won't start
- Check the app logs in Home Assistant for error messages
- Ensure you have enough disk space (PostgreSQL needs at least 100MB)

### Can't access web UI
- Verify your hostname/IP is in `application_hosts`
- Check that port 3000 is not blocked by your network
- Try using the ingress panel in the HA sidebar instead

### HA Tracker not sending data
- Check app logs for "HA Tracker:" messages
- Verify entity IDs exist in Home Assistant (Developer Tools → States)
- Ensure the entities have GPS attributes (latitude/longitude)

### Data import fails
- Check Sidekiq is running in the app logs
- Large imports may take significant time — check background job status in the Dawarich UI
