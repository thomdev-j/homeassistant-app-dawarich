# Changelog

## 1.10.1-1

- Upgrade base image to Dawarich 1.10.1 — see upstream release notes for [1.8.0](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.8.0), [1.8.1](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.8.1), [1.9.0](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.9.0), [1.9.1](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.9.1), [1.9.2](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.9.2), [1.10.0](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.10.0), and [1.10.1](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.10.1)
- **Breaking (1.10.1):** the legacy `latitude`/`longitude` columns on the `points` table are dropped. The automatic migration first copies any legacy-only coordinates into `lonlat`, so no data is lost. This runs on first boot via the addon's `db:migrate` step; existing installs already store geodata in `lonlat` (`STORE_GEODATA=true`)
- **Behavior change (1.8.0):** declining a visit now permanently deletes it (the underlying location points are kept). The "Declined" filter and Restore action were removed
- **Data no longer persisted (1.10.1):** raw import source data (`raw_data`), FIT/TCX health metrics (heart rate, cadence, power, temperature), and Google Takeout place labels are no longer stored
- New features across 1.8–1.10: stay-point visit detection (opt-in per user), Fog of War per-hexagon reveal, AirTrail flight history on Map v2, redesigned trip detail with replay scrubber and per-day notes, public track sharing and live-location sharing, **Poster Studio** (printable travel posters, PNG/PDF export), PWA install to home screen, custom Map v2 colors, mobile settings sync API, Google Photos sidecar geotagging, and transportation-mode detection for TCX and Google Takeout imports
- Poster Studio adds ~100 MB to the image and requires server-side rendering; it works on this addon's 64-bit builds (aarch64/amd64) and is unavailable only on 32-bit ARM
- Upstream lowered its default `WEB_CONCURRENCY` to 1 and `BACKGROUND_PROCESSING_CONCURRENCY` to 3 (1.10.0). The addon still sets `background_processing_concurrency` explicitly (default 5), so that is unchanged; `WEB_CONCURRENCY` is left at the new upstream default, which trims idle memory on the Raspberry Pi (upstream idle footprint dropped ~843 → ~690 MB)
- No addon config changes required. New optional upstream env vars are intentionally not exposed: `PLACE_VISITS_THROTTLE_SECONDS`, `SMTP_SSL`/`SMTP_AUTHENTICATION` (the addon sends no email), `PUID`/`PGID` (the addon runs Rails, Postgres, Redis and Sidekiq under its own s6-managed users, not the upstream container user), and `CHIBICHANGE_WIDGET_HOST`/`CHIBICHANGE_SLUG` (the "What's New" widget)

## 1.7.11-3

- Fix reverse geocoding failing with `Geocoder::NetworkError` on networks that advertise IPv6 but have no working IPv6 egress. `api.geoapify.com` is Cloudflare-fronted and publishes AAAA records; Ruby's geocoder connected to the dead IPv6 address first and failed every job, while `curl` (and the startup healthcheck) silently fell back to IPv4 via Happy Eyeballs. The container now prefers IPv4 (`/etc/gai.conf`), so the geocoder resolves IPv4 first; IPv6 is only reordered, not disabled. The startup Geoapify healthcheck now forces IPv4 so it reflects the path the geocoder actually takes ([#11](https://github.com/thomdev-j/homeassistant-app-dawarich/issues/11))

## 1.7.11-2

- Fix imports failing with "Unknown error" / "No files were successfully uploaded" on files larger than ~1 MB. The bundled nginx proxy had no `client_max_body_size` set, so it fell back to the 1 MB default and rejected the ActiveStorage upload with HTTP 413 (`client intended to send too large body`). The limit is now removed and large upload bodies stream straight to Rails instead of buffering into the RAM-backed tmpfs ([#10](https://github.com/thomdev-j/homeassistant-app-dawarich/issues/10))

## 1.7.11-1

- Upgrade base image to Dawarich 1.7.11 — see upstream [1.7.9](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.9), [1.7.10](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.10), and [1.7.11](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.11) release notes
- New Map v2 features: H3 **Hexagons** heatmap layer, area-selection bulk delete (incl. anomalies), area Edit button, GPX/GeoJSON trip downloads, hover tooltips on family member markers (1.7.9–1.7.11)
- Real-time Photon place suggestions: one Place per visit (was up to 25 candidates); `POST /api/v1/visits/:id/select_place` to swap; `place_visits` table will be removed in a follow-up release (1.7.9)
- New **Minimum visit duration** setting (default 5 min, replaces hardcoded 3 min); visit detection now ignores drive-bys and respects your enabled transportation modes; smart density fill fixed (1.7.10)
- Many fixes: overlapping tracks reconciled, late-arriving points reabsorbed, real-time family location updates, duplicate-import skip surfaced, Stats/Insights no longer 500 without `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, area geometry validation, two unused `points` indexes dropped on upgrade (frees several GB on large installs), 9 CVE-fix gem bumps (1.7.9–1.7.11)
- Addon: on first boot after upgrade, runs the upstream-recommended `dawarich:backfill_place_names` and `dawarich:cleanup_suggested_places` rake tasks once (gated by a marker file in `/data`) so existing installs get the new Place data populated
- New optional upstream env `OIDC_PKCE_ENABLED` is not exposed in the addon (off by default); request it if you need PKCE for an OIDC provider

## 1.7.8-2

- Show the Dawarich sidebar panel for non-admin Home Assistant users (`panel_admin: false`). Dawarich's own login still applies, so non-admin HA users will need their own Dawarich credentials.

## 1.7.8-1

- Upgrade base image to Dawarich 1.7.8 — see upstream [1.7.8](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.8) release notes
- Fix multi-user creation failing with "Password is too short" — default password for auto-created users (and the `admin_password` config default) is now `changemeplease` (14 chars), meeting Dawarich's 12-char minimum

## 1.7.7-1

- Upgrade base image to Dawarich 1.7.7 — see upstream [1.7.2](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.2), [1.7.3](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.3), [1.7.4](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.4), [1.7.5](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.5), [1.7.6](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.6), and [1.7.7](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.7) release notes
- Security audit fixes: path-traversal in archive import, OAuth account-link consent, SSRF blocklist for Immich/PhotoPrism URLs, 2FA brute-force rate limit, stored XSS sanitization, 12-char minimum password length, 256-bit API keys (1.7.3)
- Map v2: delete-from-card, manual transportation-mode correction, bulk visit confirm/decline, trip recalculate button, heatmap visible at city zoom, mobile safe-area fit (1.7.2, 1.7.5, 1.7.6)
- Polarsteps and Google "Timeline Edits.json" Takeout imports; clearer errors on unsupported uploads (1.7.3, 1.7.6)
- Visit suggestions now triggered by live tracking (Dawarich iOS app, OwnTracks, Overland, Traccar), not just imports (1.7.5)
- Many timezone, track-merge, stats, and reverse-geocoding fixes; duplicate-tracks prevention (1.7.5–1.7.7)
- No env-variable changes required for this addon — Prometheus migration to Yabeda (1.7.7) only affects setups with `PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_ENABLED=true`; `JWT_SECRET_KEY` no longer required (1.7.4)
