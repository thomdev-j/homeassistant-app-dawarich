# Changelog

## 1.13.0-4

- **New: open Dawarich from the sidebar and you are already signed in as yourself.** Home Assistant knows who is looking at the page, so the app can match that to your Dawarich account through the entities in `ha_tracked_entities` and skip the password. Set `ingress_auto_login` to `on` to use it
- **Nothing changes on an existing install until you ask for it.** The default, `auto`, means on for new installs and off for one that already exists, because an update should not change how you log in. Your password still works, on port 3000 and after signing out, and the admin account is untouched
- You always land in your own account. It matches you through `ha_tracked_entities` first, then through the account named after you, and only creates a new one when nothing matches, so a new person in the household gets their own map while nobody is ever put into somebody else's. Only requests coming through Home Assistant itself can claim an identity, so nothing else on your network can sign in as you

## 1.13.0-3

- **Stop the background job worker logging hundreds of Redis timeouts a day.** Redis saves to disk once a second, and on the SD cards and USB drives Home Assistant hosts usually run on, that write can take several seconds whenever something else is busy on the same disk. Redis pauses while it happens, and Sidekiq gave up after 3 seconds and reconnected. It now waits 10
- No job was ever lost to this and nothing about your data or your config changes, the log just becomes readable again

## 1.13.0-2

- **Fix the new "Tiled rendering" beta not working in the Home Assistant sidebar.** The map builds its tile address from the browser address bar, which leaves out the ingress path, so every tile came back as a 404 from Home Assistant itself and the map said "Could not load map tiles". The built-in proxy now corrects that address, and the same correction keeps the API key attached to the request. Tiles were already fine on port 3000 and stay that way
- Nothing else changes: the beta is still off until you switch it on, and no app config changes are required. If you already tried it on 1.13.0-1, reload the map page once

## 1.13.0-1

- Upgrade base image to Dawarich [1.13.0](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.13.0). Nothing changes unless you go looking for it, the one new feature is off until you switch it on
- **New "Tiled rendering" beta** under Map v2 → Settings. Points are drawn from vector tiles, so a wide date range only loads what is on screen. It does not work through the Home Assistant sidebar: the map asks for its tiles at the wrong address there and reports "Could not load map tiles". Open the app on port 3000 to try it, otherwise leave it off
- The upgrade drops three indexes on the points table that 1.12.2 made redundant, which frees disk space and makes storing every new point a little cheaper. Your points, tracks, visits and stats are untouched, and the migration verifies the replacement index is healthy before it removes anything
- No app config changes required

## 1.12.2-2

- **PostgreSQL now checkpoints every 30 minutes instead of every 5.** The upstream default flushed the dirty buffer cache twelve times an hour for the few hundred kB the app writes in between. On the SD cards and USB SSDs most Home Assistant hosts run on, that burst of fsyncs can stall the disk for seconds, and nothing else on the machine gets to write while it lasts. Your data is no less safe: a commit is made durable by the write-ahead log, and a checkpoint only decides how much of that log has to be replayed after an unclean shutdown
- **Redis no longer writes RDB snapshots.** It already appends to disk every second, so the default rule of snapshotting whenever 10000 keys change in a minute forked and rewrote the whole dataset every minute or two without making anything safer, and background job traffic alone kept it firing. Backups and restores are unaffected, they use the append-only file
- No app config changes required

## 1.12.2-1

- Upgrade base image to Dawarich [1.12.2](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.12.2)
- **Slow first boot again:** two new anomaly rules (visit reports that arrive after you already left, and cold cell-tower fixes with no motion data) are applied to every existing history in the background, and the affected tracks and stats are rebuilt. Expect high CPU for a while, your points are not touched
- Before the app starts, the upgrade also rebuilds an index on the points table. On a large history that can take several minutes, during which you get the loading page. Let it finish, do not restart the app
- **Distance for past months stays as it is.** A jump across a tracking gap no longer counts towards daily and monthly distance, but only for new data. To apply it to what you already have, run Map v2 → Settings → Recalculate tracks & stats once
- Google Timeline phone exports keep altitude, accuracy and speed from `rawSignals` again. Points already imported keep their empty values, and importing the same file again skips them, so delete the old import first if you want those fields filled
- Fixes: the map no longer jumps to a place you just left, the Tracks layer toggle survives a page reload, the Family page no longer fails on old points without a timestamp, and exports no longer fail on legacy places without coordinates
- No app config changes required

## 1.12.1-1

- Upgrade base image to Dawarich [1.12.0](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.12.0) and [1.12.1](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.12.1). The old Leaflet map is gone, `/map` now always opens the MapLibre map, so a browser without WebGL can no longer show a map. German, Spanish and French were added, switchable under Settings → General
- **Slow first boot again:** visit and transportation detection were rewritten, and the upgrade re-detects every account in the background. Expect high CPU for a while, your points are not touched. Old visits and tracks keep their previous detection until that finishes
- No app config changes required

## 1.11.0-3

- **Fix export and import files being stored outside `/data`, where no backup saw them and every app update threw them away.** `ln -sf` puts the link inside an existing directory instead of replacing it, and the Dawarich image ships a `storage/.keep`, so the link landed at `/var/app/storage/storage`. Present since 1.3.3-1. **Your location history is not affected:** points, tracks, trips, visits, places and stats all live in PostgreSQL under `/data/postgres` and are backed up as usual. What was lost are export downloads and the archived original file of an import ([#17](https://github.com/thomdev-j/homeassistant-app-dawarich/issues/17))
- Already stranded files cannot be rescued by this update, which recreates the container first. To keep them, run this **before updating**: `docker exec $(docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep dawarich) sh -c 'find /var/app/storage -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 ! -name .keep ! -name storage -exec mv -n {} /data/dawarich/storage/ \;'`

## 1.11.0-2

- **Rails commands now work from a shell in the app.** `rails runner`, `rails console` and rake tasks failed with `OTP_ENCRYPTION_PRIMARY_KEY required in production`, which looks like a broken install but is not: Dawarich derives its OTP encryption keys from `SECRET_KEY_BASE`, and app options are resolved at startup and passed to the services through s6 rather than baked into the image, so a `docker exec` shell never saw them. Interactive shells now load that environment, and a `dawarich-rails` wrapper is included — `docker exec -it app_5ba57643_dawarich dawarich-rails runner "…"`. See _Running Rails commands_ in the docs ([#16](https://github.com/thomdev-j/homeassistant-app-dawarich/issues/16))

## 1.11.0-1

- Upgrade base image to Dawarich 1.11.0 — see upstream release notes for [1.10.2](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.10.2), [1.10.3](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.10.3), and [1.11.0](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.11.0)
- **Slow first boot:** 1.11.0 re-checks every point against new GPS noise rules and rebuilds tracks and stats. Expect high CPU and disk load for a while — let it finish
- **The Accuracy Threshold setting is gone.** Any saved value is ignored, and points it used to hide come back
- Fixes the crash loop some instances hit upgrading to 1.10.1 (dropping the legacy `points.latitude`/`longitude` columns could not get its lock)
- No addon config changes required

## 1.10.1-2

- **Fix data loss when restoring a Home Assistant backup.** Backups exclude the raw PostgreSQL files (`backup_exclude: postgres/**`) and ship a `pg_dumpall` dump instead, but nothing ever imported that dump again — a restored app came up with a freshly initialized, empty database and every recorded location was silently gone, even though the dump sat unused in `/data/dawarich/backup.sql`. The app now imports it on the first start after a restore and logs how many users and points came back. The import only runs into a database nobody has used yet (a freshly initialized cluster, or one where no user ever signed in, nothing was imported and fewer than 1000 points exist), so it can never overwrite data on an app that is already in use
- Fix a partial `pg_dumpall` being packed into a backup as if it were complete: the dump is written to a temporary file and only moved into place once it succeeds. A failed dump now fails the backup instead of quietly shipping an unusable one
- Report a failing admin-user creation instead of swallowing it. `admin_password` shorter than Dawarich's 12-character minimum made `User.create!` raise "Password is too short"; the error scrolled past in the log and the app started with **no account to log in with**, which looks exactly like a forgotten password. The password length is now checked at startup and a failure is reported explicitly
- Set `DOMAIN` (from the first entry of `application_hosts`) so Dawarich can build absolute URLs in Devise mails. Without it, an account that got locked after 10 failed logins hit `Missing host to link to!` while rendering the unlock mail and the login page returned HTTP 500

## 1.10.1-1

- Upgrade base image to Dawarich 1.10.1 — see upstream release notes for [1.8.0](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.8.0), [1.8.1](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.8.1), [1.9.0](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.9.0), [1.9.1](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.9.1), [1.9.2](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.9.2), [1.10.0](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.10.0), and [1.10.1](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.10.1)
- **Breaking (1.10.1):** the legacy `latitude`/`longitude` columns on the `points` table are dropped. The automatic migration first copies any legacy-only coordinates into `lonlat`, so no data is lost. This runs on first boot via the addon's `db:migrate` step; existing installs already store geodata in `lonlat` (`STORE_GEODATA=true`)
- **Behavior change (1.8.0):** declining a visit now permanently deletes it (the underlying location points are kept). The "Declined" filter and Restore action were removed
- **Data no longer persisted (1.10.1):** raw import source data (`raw_data`), FIT/TCX health metrics (heart rate, cadence, power, temperature), and Google Takeout place labels are no longer stored
- New features across 1.8–1.10: stay-point visit detection (opt-in per user), Fog of War per-hexagon reveal, AirTrail flight history on Map v2, redesigned trip detail with replay scrubber and per-day notes, public track sharing and live-location sharing, **Poster Studio** (printable travel posters, PNG/PDF export), PWA install to home screen, custom Map v2 colors, mobile settings sync API, Google Photos sidecar geotagging, and transportation-mode detection for TCX and Google Takeout imports
- Poster Studio adds ~100 MB to the image and requires server-side rendering; it works on this addon's 64-bit builds (aarch64/amd64) and is unavailable only on 32-bit ARM
- Upstream lowered its default `WEB_CONCURRENCY` to 1 and `BACKGROUND_PROCESSING_CONCURRENCY` to 3 (1.10.0). The addon still sets `background_processing_concurrency` explicitly (default 5), so that is unchanged; `WEB_CONCURRENCY` is left at the new upstream default, which trims idle memory on the Raspberry Pi (upstream idle footprint dropped ~843 → ~690 MB)
- No addon config changes required. New optional upstream env vars are intentionally not exposed: `PLACE_VISITS_THROTTLE_SECONDS`, `SMTP_SSL`/`SMTP_AUTHENTICATION` (the addon sends no email), `PUID`/`PGID` (the addon runs Rails, Postgres, Redis and Sidekiq under its own s6-managed users, not the upstream container user), and `CHIBICHANGE_WIDGET_HOST`/`CHIBICHANGE_SLUG` (the "What's New" widget)

## 1.7.11-3

- Fix reverse geocoding failing with `Geocoder::NetworkError` on networks that advertise IPv6 but have no working IPv6 egress. `api.geoapify.com` is Cloudflare-fronted and publishes AAAA records; Ruby's geocoder connected to the dead IPv6 address first and failed every job, while `curl` (and the startup healthcheck) silently fell back to IPv4 via Happy Eyeballs. The container now prefers IPv4 (`/etc/gai.conf`), so the geocoder resolves IPv4 first; IPv6 is only reordered, not disabled. The startup Geoapify healthcheck now forces IPv4 so it reflects the path the geocoder actually takes ([#11](https://github.com/thomdev-j/homeassistant-app-dawarich/issues/11))

## 1.7.11-2

- Fix imports failing with "Unknown error" / "No files were successfully uploaded" on files larger than ~1 MB. The bundled nginx proxy had no `client_max_body_size` set, so it fell back to the 1 MB default and rejected the ActiveStorage upload with HTTP 413 (`client intended to send too large body`). The limit is now removed and large upload bodies stream straight to Rails instead of buffering into the RAM-backed tmpfs ([#10](https://github.com/thomdev-j/homeassistant-app-dawarich/issues/10))

## 1.7.11-1

- Upgrade base image to Dawarich 1.7.11 — see upstream [1.7.9](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.9), [1.7.10](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.10), and [1.7.11](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.11) release notes
- New Map v2 features: H3 **Hexagons** heatmap layer, area-selection bulk delete (incl. anomalies), area Edit button, GPX/GeoJSON trip downloads, hover tooltips on family member markers (1.7.9–1.7.11)
- Real-time Photon place suggestions: one Place per visit (was up to 25 candidates); `POST /api/v1/visits/:id/select_place` to swap; `place_visits` table will be removed in a follow-up release (1.7.9)
- New **Minimum visit duration** setting (default 5 min, replaces hardcoded 3 min); visit detection now ignores drive-bys and respects your enabled transportation modes; smart density fill fixed (1.7.10)
- Many fixes: overlapping tracks reconciled, late-arriving points reabsorbed, real-time family location updates, duplicate-import skip surfaced, Stats/Insights no longer 500 without `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, area geometry validation, two unused `points` indexes dropped on upgrade (frees several GB on large installs), 9 CVE-fix gem bumps (1.7.9–1.7.11)
- Addon: on first boot after upgrade, runs the upstream-recommended `dawarich:backfill_place_names` and `dawarich:cleanup_suggested_places` rake tasks once (gated by a marker file in `/data`) so existing installs get the new Place data populated
- New optional upstream env `OIDC_PKCE_ENABLED` is not exposed in the addon (off by default); request it if you need PKCE for an OIDC provider

## 1.7.8-2

- Show the Dawarich sidebar panel for non-admin Home Assistant users (`panel_admin: false`). Dawarich's own login still applies, so non-admin HA users will need their own Dawarich credentials.

## 1.7.8-1

- Upgrade base image to Dawarich 1.7.8 — see upstream [1.7.8](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.8) release notes
- Fix multi-user creation failing with "Password is too short" — default password for auto-created users (and the `admin_password` config default) is now `changemeplease` (14 chars), meeting Dawarich's 12-char minimum

## 1.7.7-1

- Upgrade base image to Dawarich 1.7.7 — see upstream [1.7.2](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.2), [1.7.3](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.3), [1.7.4](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.4), [1.7.5](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.5), [1.7.6](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.6), and [1.7.7](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.7) release notes
- Security audit fixes: path-traversal in archive import, OAuth account-link consent, SSRF blocklist for Immich/PhotoPrism URLs, 2FA brute-force rate limit, stored XSS sanitization, 12-char minimum password length, 256-bit API keys (1.7.3)
- Map v2: delete-from-card, manual transportation-mode correction, bulk visit confirm/decline, trip recalculate button, heatmap visible at city zoom, mobile safe-area fit (1.7.2, 1.7.5, 1.7.6)
- Polarsteps and Google "Timeline Edits.json" Takeout imports; clearer errors on unsupported uploads (1.7.3, 1.7.6)
- Visit suggestions now triggered by live tracking (Dawarich iOS app, OwnTracks, Overland, Traccar), not just imports (1.7.5)
- Many timezone, track-merge, stats, and reverse-geocoding fixes; duplicate-tracks prevention (1.7.5–1.7.7)
- No env-variable changes required for this addon — Prometheus migration to Yabeda (1.7.7) only affects setups with `PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_ENABLED=true`; `JWT_SECRET_KEY` no longer required (1.7.4)

## 1.7.1-1

- Upgrade base image to Dawarich 1.7.1 — see upstream [1.7.0](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.0) and [1.7.1](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/1.7.1) release notes for user-facing changes
